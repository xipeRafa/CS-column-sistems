 A CSS Grid framework that leverages Sass to automatically generate all potential slice width variations within a defined number.  

Grid columns are expressed in reduced fraction modifiers, no percentages are repeated and all classes follow a BEM methodology.  

Grid columns are created with floats.  The grid rows require clearfixing (which is assumed your parent project would have). 

Class names, padding and media query column collapsing are controlled within the configuration.  Pushing is allowed via class names.  Collapsing margins and stacking columns on breakpoints can be controlled by class names on the row.
